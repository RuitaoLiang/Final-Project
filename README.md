# **Global Music Player**

Global music player is a physical globe which plays different music as a player touches different continent on the globe.
## **Summary**
  The goal of my project is to use the technology to help people learn music from different areas.
  The reason I choose this subject is that I want to find a way to help people understand various culture in our world, while music is part of the culture.
  As a player touches different continent on the globe, computer will play the music created in that area. For example, when a player touches Africa on the globe, he or she will hear the African music collection. If I still have time after finish this, I will add some color lights on it. So the player will hear the music and see the lightning in that area. 
 

## **Component Parts**

On the hardware side, I will need a globe, fabric sensors, some LED lights, Feather board and my computer.
-  a globe cover with fabric sensors(input)
- LED lights (output)

On the software side,I will need some music collection of 7 continents.
- music player (output)

## **Challenges**

Finding the useful traffic data API is a challenge for me, since the data may not update very fast if it's free of charge.
If Using a mapbox to display my map is not supporting user selection, I will need to draw my own map, which is a big challenge for me.

Also building a software to let user choose the route is new to me.
Finally adding LED lights to feather board and connecting it to the traffic data is also quite complicated, so I expect to take a long time to try and make errors.

## **Timeline**

- Week 1: Write proposal,online search traffic data API,and learn what data it generate and which is useful to my project
- Week 2: use mapbox to display the map and write code to play music according the trafiic data
- Week 3: build a user selection route map and make code to play music
- Week 4: add lighting to the project and control it with code and traffic data.
- Week 5: Present complete project.
