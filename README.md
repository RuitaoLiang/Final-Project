# **Travel Planner**

Travel planner is a tool which help users to find a better route by play music and showing different lighting.
## **Summary**
  The goal of my project is to use the technology to help people identify the traffic situation and choose their 
routes.
The reason I choose this subject is related to my commute experience. Since I need to drive to San francisco
campus from the east bay every weekday, it's hard to look at the map on my phone to check the traffic condition.
Most of the time I listen to music while I am driving. So if there is a smart map that can tell drivers the traffic 
condition by playing different music, it will be much safer to look at the screen while driving. For some people who
like to check the traffic condition before they take off, I want to use different colors of LED lights with music 
to indicate the traffic condition.
The ideal way is that user choose the route with their voice, and the smart map will tell the user how is 
the traffic condition with music and lighting.Because we only have 5 weeks to execute the project, I will start
by making the automatically-selected routes map with music.According to the real time traffic data, the program will
play various music. If I finish this before 3 weeks, I will build the user selection routes map. As user choose different
routes, the program will play different kinds of music. 
 

## **Component Parts**

On the hardware side, I will need some LED lights, Feather board and my computer.
- LED lights (output)

On the software side,I will need mapbox to display the map and traffic data API.
- music player (output)
- mapbox(output)
-traffic data(input)

## **Challenges**

Connecting the globe and fabic sensors is a challenge for me, since I never use this kind of sensors before.Also writing code to let user choose the music is new to me.

## **Timeline**

- Week 1: Write proposal,search traffic data API
- Week 2: use mapbox to display the map and write code to play music 
- Week 3: build a user selection a route and make code to let them play different music
- Week 4: add lighting to the project and control it with code
- Week 5: Present complete project.
