# **Global Music Player**

Global music player is a physical globe which plays different music as a player touches different continent on the globe.
## **Summary**
  The goal of my project is to use the technology to help people learn music from different areas.
  The reason I choose this subject is that I want to find a way to help people understand various culture in our world, while music is part of the culture.
  As a player touches different continent on the globe, computer will play the music created in that area. For example, when a player touches Africa on the globe, he or she will hear the African music collection. If I still have time after finish this, I will add some color lights on it. So the player will hear the music and see the lightning in that area. 
 

## **Component Parts**

On the hardware side, I will need a globe, fabric sensors, some LED lights, Feather board and my computer.
-  a globe cover with fabric sensors(input)
- LED lights (output)

On the software side,I will need some music collection of 7 continents.
- music player (output)

## **Challenges**

Connecting the globe and fabic sensors is a challenge for me, since I never use this kind of sensors before.Also writing code to let user choose the music is new to me.

## **Timeline**

- Week 1: Write proposal,get the materials 
- Week 2: connect the sensors to the globe and write code to play music 
- Week 3: build a user selection web and make code to let them choose different music in one area
- Week 4: add lighting to the project and control it with code
- Week 5: Present complete project.
